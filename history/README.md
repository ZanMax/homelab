# History of my HomeLab

### Story of my HomeLab.

Story of my homelab starts from early 2000s.
It was a time when I was a student and I had a lot of free time.
I was interested in computers, and I was playing with them a lot.
I was playing with Linux, BSD on my old PCs.

### Hosting services
After building my first homelab server, I started to host my own services. 
For my it was a great experience, because I was able to learn a lot of new things.
With time, I was hosting not only my own services but also services for my friends and colleagues.

I was hosting services like:
- Web services
- Mail services
- DNS services

After about 2 years I hosted even several local internet shops.
If was a great experience.

### Move to cloud
After a few years, I decided to move my services to the cloud.
I was using DigitalOcean, Hetzner and AWS.
I had a lot of problems with DigitalOcean, because they were not stable.
They deleted more than 500 000+ clients files without possibility to restore them.
Also, I had a problems with VPS from DigitalOcean. So for me DigitalOcean is not a good choice.
Just for testing or some experiments it's ok but not for production.

After moving to AWS I save a tons of nerves. :)
AWS is a great cloud provider. I was using it for about 7+ years.

For some services I also used Hetzner and Azure.
I can recommend Hetzner for hosting some not critical services.

### Move to Kubernetes
After a few years on VPS and bare metal servers, I decided to move to Kubernetes.
I was using Kubernetes for about 3 years for hosting my services.
Also, I use Kubernetes for hosting services at my work.

### Acquaintance with ARM
My first experience with ARM was with Raspberry Pi.
I was using it for some experiments and I liked it.
Little board with a lot of possibilities.
In the future, I decided to use ARM for my homelab and my work.
Right now I have cluster with 5 Rock PI 3 boards. In the future, I will add new cluster with Rock PI 5 boards.

### My homelab right now
Right now I have several clusters on my homelab.
In general, I have more than 20 servers on my homelab.
It's about 500Gb+ of RAM, 20Tb+ of storages and 100+ cores.

#### Thanks for reading my story.
I hope you will enjoy my homelab.
